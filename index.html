            <h3>Every idea <img src="assets/img/idea.png" alt=""><br> starts with a <br> need</h3>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract
                more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
                stored
                on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I
                thought.
                I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea,
                but
                the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

                will <br>
                learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
